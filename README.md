# Sprint 2 Project

The 2nd project of my journey of becoming a front end developer.

## Learing How to Learn Website

__Brief:__ A single page website with animations, tables, lists and flex containers, with file structure according to the BEM methodology.

__Animation:__ Both animation made with a single block called "Rotation", animation made with KeyFrame and prefix added for compatibility.

__Tables:__ Same table block used in Digits and Kaufman blocks, with a dark theme modifer for the Kaufman block.

__BEM:__ All blocks are nested according to the BEM nested file structure:
Block -
__Element, Block.css -
_Modifier, Block__Element.css -
Block__Element_modifier.css

All .css files are imported through index.css.

## To Do List

* Make a form for visitors to add comments.
